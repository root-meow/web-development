<h1>Tapenade (Olive spread)</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and is always a big hit at
    parties. My father recommends:</p>

<p>
    "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just
    bring it up to room temparature before you serve it. In the winter, try
    serving it warm."
</p>

  <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
  <li>2/3c. kalamata olives</li>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<blockquote>
