    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique
    called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
    (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set
    to the target temparature you want the food to be cooked to. In his
    book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as
     <q>ultra-low temparature poaching.</q></p>

    <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
    Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
      <time>November 30</time>.</p>

    <p><b>Warning</b>:<i>Sous vide cooked salmon is not pesteurized. Avoid it if
      you are pregnant or have immunity issues</i>.</p>
